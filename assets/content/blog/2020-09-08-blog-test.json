  "body": "## Raison d'etre\n\n### Why have a blog?\n\nI'm a philosophy grad student, about halfway through my PhD. I have this problem where I become consumed with some idea or another for a short span, but I never stay on a topic long enough to make some kind of concrete, lasting contribution. Besides this, I like the informal but public-facing character of blogs, and it's a relatively unintimidating way to write things and save the thoughts for later. I'm hoping that these blogs can be rendered into more primary professional outputs. Besides all of this, it would be cool to be able to share my thoughts with an audience! So, here goes."
